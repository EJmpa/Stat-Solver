Try applying for Graduate Trainee Programmes. It may be tough to get in, but its definitely going to help. And if you're unable to get into any of the Big 4's, just keep applying for Graduate Trainee Programmes. Also, try to widen your search. Go beyond Nigerian companies. Don't limit yourself to a particular job or location.
